# contract-manager

The purpose of this application is to have a virtual contract consigment with signature possibility.
A supervisor can then send out a contract to a driver.
Onto the contract the driver can then ask for a signature which will be available in the control panel for the supervisor.
This removes the hassle with paper contracts.
